# üîç Environment Variables Debug

## Issue Identified

The gas sponsorship is not working because there are **environment variable access issues**. Here's what we found:

### Current Environment Variables (from `.env.local`):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=clzwgw5uj05wgm8bkjn5kw7kp
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=wkftoNwmx1w1I2Zo3Kljuv0T28pCBQy0
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=d6a1b0a4-4f71-4a92-bb4c-5e5f1b8c9d7e
```

### The Problem:
1. **Placeholder Policy ID**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID` is set to a placeholder UUID instead of a real Alchemy Gas Manager Policy ID
2. **Multiple Configurations**: There are two different smart wallet configurations (Privy vs Alchemy Account Kit) that might be conflicting
3. **Environment Variable Validation**: The validation logic correctly identifies the placeholder as invalid

### How Gas Sponsorship Should Work:

1. **Privy Smart Wallet Provider** gets the policy ID from environment variables
2. **Paymaster Context** is configured in the `SmartWalletsProvider` 
3. **Transaction Sending** automatically uses gas sponsorship when paymaster is available

### The Fix:

Replace the placeholder Policy ID with a real one:

```bash
# ‚ùå CURRENT (doesn't work):
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=d6a1b0a4-4f71-4a92-bb4c-5e5f1b8c9d7e

# ‚úÖ NEEDED (get from Alchemy Dashboard):
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=your_real_alchemy_policy_id
```

### Steps to Get Real Policy ID:

1. Go to https://dashboard.alchemy.com
2. Navigate to "Gas Manager"
3. Create a new sponsorship policy
4. Configure it for Sepolia testnets (Ethereum, Base, Optimism)
5. Copy the Policy ID
6. Replace the placeholder in `.env.local`
7. Restart the development server

### Test Gas Sponsorship:

After fixing the Policy ID:
1. Connect smart wallet
2. Send a transaction
3. Check console logs for "Transaction was sponsored: true"
4. Verify no gas fees are charged to user
