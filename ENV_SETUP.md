## üö® CRITICAL: Fix the Paymaster Error

The error you're seeing is because the Alchemy Gas Manager policy ID needs to be properly configured. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. **Get Your Alchemy Gas Manager Policy ID**

1. Go to [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com)
2. Navigate to "Gas Manager" 
3. Create a new policy or copy existing policy ID
4. Make sure the policy is configured for Ethereum Sepolia testnet

### 2. **Update Your Environment Variables**

Replace the placeholder in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# REPLACE THIS PLACEHOLDER:
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=d6a1b0a4-4f71-4a92-bb4c-5e5f1b8c9d7e

# WITH YOUR REAL POLICY ID:
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=your_real_policy_id_from_alchemy
```

### 3. **Alternative: Disable Gas Sponsorship (Temporary)**

If you don't have an Alchemy Gas Manager policy yet, you can disable it temporarily:

```bash
# Comment out or remove the policy ID:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=

# Or set it to empty:
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_POLICY_ID=
```

## üìã Complete Environment Setup

# Privy App ID (Get from dashboard.privy.io)
