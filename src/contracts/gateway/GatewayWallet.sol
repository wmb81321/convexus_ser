/// @notice This contract allows users to deposit supported tokens. Once deposits are observed in a finalized block by
/// the operator, the user may request an attestation to instantly mint those funds on another chain. Minted funds are
/// then burned on the chain where they were deposited.
///
/// @notice The available balance is the amount the user has deposited that may be used instantly on any chain, subject
/// to finality observed by the operator and an attestation obtained from the API. To obtain an attestation, the user
/// must provide the operator with a signed message containing the desired parameters, which acts as a burn intent that
/// will allow the operator to burn those funds once the mint is observed on the destination chain.
///
/// @notice To mint funds on another chain, the user may use an attestation obtained from the API to call `gatewayMint`
/// on the `GatewayMinter` contract on the desired chain. This will mint the funds to the requested destination, and may
/// be composed with other actions via a multicall contract or SCA implementation. A fee is deducted from the user's
/// balance within the `GatewayWallet` contract in addition to the requested amount.
///
/// @notice For same-chain withdrawals, users can obtain an attestation from the API similar to cross-chain mints. They
/// then call `gatewayMint` on the `GatewayMinter` contract to receive their funds at their specified address, while
/// their original deposit in the `GatewayWallet` contract is subsequently burned. A fee is deducted from the user's
/// balance within the `GatewayWallet` contract in addition to the requested amount, since Circle incurs gas costs
/// for the burn operation.
///
/// @notice To ensure funds are withdrawable even if the API is unavailable, users may withdraw permissionlessly using a
/// two-step process. First, the user must call `initiateWithdrawal` with the desired withdrawal amount. After a delay,
/// the user may call `withdraw` to complete the withdrawal and receive the funds. This delay ensures that no
/// double-spends are possible and that the operator has time to burn any funds that are minted. The amount that is in
/// the process of being withdrawn will no longer be available as soon as the withdrawal initiation is observed by the
/// operator in a finalized block. If a double-spend was attempted, the contract will burn the user's funds from both
/// their `available` and `withdrawing` balances.
